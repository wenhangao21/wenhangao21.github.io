# About me
I'm a third year Ph.D. student in Applied Mathematics at Stony Brook University supervised by [Professor Yi Liu](https://jacoblau0513.github.io/). 

Previously, I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) in both [applied mathematics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ams/)ðŸ“™ and [pure mathematics](http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/)ðŸ“•.

My research focuses on **Geometric Deep Learning, Generative Models, Neural Operators, and AI for Science in general**.

The best way to contact me is through email: wenhan(dot)gao(at symbol)stonybrook(dot)edu ðŸ“«
